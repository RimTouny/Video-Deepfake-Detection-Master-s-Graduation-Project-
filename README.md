# **Video Deepfake Detection Master's Graduation Project**
Undertook a comprehensive exploration of fake and real video datasets, employing advanced techniques in face detection, data preprocessing, and the creation of structured training, validation, and testing sets..This project holds significance as it served as the culmination of my Master's degree in Ottawa in 2023.



        Design Overview
        The deepfake detection system utilizes a multi-stage approach involving data preprocessing, feature extraction, deep learning-based classification, and a user-friendly web interface. It employs state-of-the-art algorithms to distinguish between authentic and manipulated videos, addressing the challenge of deepfake proliferation.
